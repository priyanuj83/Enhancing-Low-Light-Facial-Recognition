# Enhancing Facial Recognition for Low-Light Images
In this project, we investigate the performance of state-of-the-art facial recognition models implemented in PyTorchâ€”specifically, FaceNet, ArcFace, VGGFace, OpenFace, and Dlib. Although existing literature demonstrates that these deep learning models achieve high accuracy when trained on well-illuminated, high-quality datasets, their effectiveness diminishes in low-light conditions where essential facial features are obscured. For example, while the Dlib face recognition model has been reported to achieve 99% accuracy on optimally illuminated datasets, its performance under low-light conditions remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, our project aims to compare and evaluate the performance degradation of these models on a low-light facial image dataset. A key component of our study is the development of an image preprocessing pipeline that employs image enhancement algorithms to improve the visibility of facial features in poorly illuminated images. By comparing model performance before and after applying the enhancement pipeline, we seek to quantify the enhancement factor and understand the computational costs associated with such preprocessing.
